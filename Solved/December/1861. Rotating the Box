First solution incorrect
Thought shifting stones to the right was optimal but wasnt need to go right to left


class Solution(object):
    def rotateTheBox(self, boxGrid):
        rowCount = len(boxGrid)
        colCount = len(boxGrid[0])

        grid = [["."] * colCount for _ in range(rowCount)]

        for i in range(rowCount):
            stones = 0
            for j in range(colCount):
                if boxGrid[i][j] == "#":
                    stones += 1
                elif boxGrid[i][j] == "*":
                    # Place stones to the left of obstacle
                    if stones > 0:
                        grid[i][j - stones : j] = ["#"] * stones
                        stones = 0]]
                    grid[i][j] = "*"
                elif j == colCount - 1:
                    # Place remaining stones at the end
                    if stones > 0:
                        grid[i][j - stones + 1 : j + 1] = ["#"] * stones
                        stones = 0

        # Rotate 90 degrees clockwise
        rotated = [[0] * rowCount for _ in range(colCount)]
        for i in range(rowCount):
            for j in range(colCount):
                rotated[j][rowCount - i - 1] = grid[i][j]

        return rotated

Second correct solution

class Solution(object):
    def rotateTheBox(self, boxGrid):
        rowCount = len(boxGrid)
        colCount = len(boxGrid[0])

        # Step 1: Shift rocks to the right
        newGrid = [["."] * colCount for _ in range(rowCount)]

        for i in range(rowCount):
            writePos = colCount - 1  # Start writing rocks from the right
            for j in range(colCount - 1, -1, -1):  # Iterate from right to left
                if boxGrid[i][j] == "#":
                    newGrid[i][writePos] = "#"
                    writePos -= 1
                elif boxGrid[i][j] == "*":
                    newGrid[i][j] = "*"
                    writePos = j - 1  # Rocks can't go past obstacle

        # Step 2: Rotate the box 90 degrees clockwise
        rotated = [[0] * rowCount for _ in range(colCount)]
        for i in range(rowCount):
            for j in range(colCount):
                rotated[j][rowCount - i - 1] = newGrid[i][j]

        return rotated

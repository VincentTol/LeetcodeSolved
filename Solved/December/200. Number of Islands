# Use recursion to eliminate surrounding 1's as 0. Similar to minesweeper
# However tricky part is trying to count the islands, can remove but dont know 
# where to put the +1 of islands
# trick is to not put it in the recursion, call the dfs outside, and then increment
# after done doing the dfs 
# Just need to make sure not go outside bounds of 2d list

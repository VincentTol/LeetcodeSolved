        # Start with left pointer on index 0
        # right pointer on index = len(numbers)
        # right pointer moves left until it is less than the target
        # Now how do we decide whether the left pointer should move or right
        # [1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 14, 20] target = 10
        # Then I guess left pointer would keep moving right until it finds target
        # Want to find edge case where this cant happen
        # [1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10] target = 9
        # so yes move left pointer until it finds target but if sum becomes greater than 
        # target then move right pointer left
        left = 0
        right = len(numbers) - 1

        while left < right:
            s = numbers[left] + numbers[right]

            if s == target:

                left += 1
